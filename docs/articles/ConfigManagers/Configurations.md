# Configurations

The configuration management is based on the *MORYX Toolkit* with the platforms configuration management. So they work like in every other platform (e.g. runtime)
To handle the frameworks configurations a configurator can be started with the config runmodes

## Config RunMode

This *RunMode* loads the configurator from the installed packages. If you don't want to have this configurator, you can remove the package. Otherwise you only can deactivate the configuratior in the AppConfig.

The configurator can be opened with keyboard key *CTRL*. You should press the key while the framework is loading. You can also add the ´--configurator´ command line argument. Don't forget to set the RunMode back to your favorite.

## Configurator

### Starting the configurator

You can start the configurator of the framework with the command line argument ´--configurator´. Optionally use the *CTRL* key at startup. (Press *CTRL* and then click on the heart of lead). Don't forget to set the *RunMode* back to your previous setting.
