# Caliburn Conventions

## Naming Conventions

Guidelines for usage of Caliburn.Micro

- Usage of caliburn micro base classes - wherever possible
- Do not use button name as event. Use the following notation to see the real event which will be wired by caliburn:

````xml
<TextBox cal:Message.Attach="[Event KeyDown] = [Action OnKeyPressed($dataContext)]" />
````

- for properties use the good old binding

````xml
<TextBlock Text="{Binding MyProperty}" />
````

- Per default caliburn view locator is used
  - If required castle may be extended to find a custom view for a view model
- Use the default caliburn naming conventions (TestView and TestViewModel)

## IntelliSense

For IntelliSense add the following code to your Window/UserControl. Note that it also can be helpful for the XAML preview in the Visual Studio.

````xml
<UserControl x:Class="..."
             ...
             mc:Ignorable="d"
             d:DataContext="{d:DesignInstance MyViewModel}">
        [...]
</UserControl>
````
